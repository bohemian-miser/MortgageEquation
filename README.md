# The Mortgage Equation
Are you better off buying a property, or renting?

Renting sucks, but even if you _can_ buy a place, is it worth $30,000 every year?



Mortgages, like any investemnt, are complex because nobody knows what the markets will do, but fundamentally the maths is not too complex. This site lets you experiment with different rates to understand how they affect this equation.

### Cost of a Mortgage:
* Interest
* Fees
* \- Appreciation (How much the value of the house goes up)

### Cost of Renting:
* Rent
* \- Interest (Investing your money in stocks and other investments, instead of a house)
 
When `Cost of a Mortgage` < `Cost of Renting` you should _consider_ if a mortgage is feasible and consult a professional about it.


## What's not covered here
This considers a _snapshot in time_. This tool would be accurate if you could guarrentee:
* Stock markets and house prices go up reliably
* Meeting all your repayments for the full mortgage duration
* The interest rate never changes
* You never have any unexpected fees, or damage to your property


On top of this, depending on where you live there are going to be nuanced tax implications, especially if you lease out a spare room. You can estimate these by using the 'Fees' slider or reducing the 'Appreciation' slider.

#### This model does not include:
* Rate changes over time.
  * It might make sense to keep renting today, but if rent and house prices doubled next month, then you would have been better off buying.
* Different mortgage types (Offset, fixed term, variable, redraw, etc..)
